All Hola Code licenses have many important features in common. 
Every license helps creators — we call them licensors if they use our tools — retain copyright while allowing others to copy, 
distribute, and make some uses of their work — at least non-commercially. Every Hola Code license also ensures licensors 
get the credit for their work they deserve. Every Creative Commons license works around the world and lasts as long as 
applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright). 
These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors can choose to grant additional 
permissions when deciding how they want their work to be used.  A Hola Code licensor answers a few simple questions on the 
path to choosing a license — first, do I want to allow commercial use or not, and then second, do I want to allow derivative 
works or not? If a licensor decides to allow derivative works, she may also choose to require that anyone who uses the work — 
we call them licensees — to make that new work available under the same license terms. We call this idea “ShareAlike” and it 
is one of the mechanisms that (if chosen) helps the digital commons grow over time. ShareAlike is inspired by the G
NU General Public License, used by many free and open source software projects.  Our licenses do not affect freedoms that the 
law grants to users of creative works otherwise protected by copyright, such as exceptions and limitations to copyright law 
like fair dealing. Hola Code licenses require licensees to get permission to do any of the things with a work that the 
law reserves exclusively to a licensor and that the license does not expressly allow. Licensees must credit the licensor, 
keep copyright notices intact on all copies of the work, and link to the license from copies of the work. Licensees cannot 
use technological measures to restrict access to the work by others.
