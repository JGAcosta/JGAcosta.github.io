             <p class="about me">I am a high school graduate from Phoenix, AZ
             where i grew up for the past 35 yrs. In early 2004 I returned to
             my native country of which i now reside. I have lived and travelled
             to various states of the republic.
            <br>
            I had worked for many years previously as a CSR but couldn't quite
            fit into the same old routine and was looking for a greater change.
            <br>
            It was then that i applied for Hola Code and was accepted to undergo
            a long 5 month intensive course in programming.
